## About:  
Just Enough is a simple website that aims to help users learn some basics and introductory phrases 
of some new langauges. There is a Flashcard tab where users can study the included terms and their 
English translations, and there is a Quiz tab where they can put their new knowledge to the test. 
Additionally, there is a Dictionary tab where users can search any English word and get the English
 definition and a web-generated translation into every language included on this site.
